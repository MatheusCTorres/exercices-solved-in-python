# Exercises solved using loop (for and while)

1. Write a program that asks for a number between **1 and 10** and prints the multiplication table for that number properly aligned, using a **for loop**.

2. Write a program that asks for a positive integer, n, and prints on the screen all the numbers between 0 and n that are multiples of 3 but not 5. Solve with a for loop.

3. Write a program that receives a positive integer and calculates the value of the **Fibonacci function**. For **N = 1** or **2**, **N** must be returned, otherwise it returns the sum of the two previous values.

4. A number is **prime** if it *is an integer greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself*. Write a program that asks for an integer and says whether that number is prime or not. If the number entered is invalid, inform about it and ask again.

5. Ask the user to enter a number between **1000 and 10000**. If you do not respect it, inform it properly and ask again. Print all prime numbers between 1 and the number entered. Use break instructions wherever possible and continue. Suggestion:

* use a cycle that cycles through all the numbers 1 and the number entered.

* In each iteration, you should test whether it is a cousin or not. You will therefore need to include the code from the previous exercise (which uses a second inner cycle).

* the break command only interrupts the cycle that contains it directly.

6. Write a program that asks the user to enter test scores, between 0 and 100. The number of numbers is unknown at the outset. The reading ends when -1 is entered. Use break instructions wherever possible and continue. Without resorting to extra functions, such as min and max, calculate and print on the screen:

* The amount of notes.
* The best note.
* The worst note.
* The average of the inserted notes.
